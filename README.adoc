= Eclipse Vert.x GSoC 2024 Assessment App
:toc:
:toc-placement!:

In 2024, the Eclipse Vert.x team proposes a subject for Google Summer of Code through the Eclipse Foundation.

In addition to the GSoC proposal document, we ask candidates to implement a Vert.x application.
This will help us make sure candidates have a basic understanding of asynchronous programming and the Vert.x toolkit.
